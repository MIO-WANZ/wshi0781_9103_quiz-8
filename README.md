# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

1.Inspired by teamLab's "Universe of Water Particles," I aim to create a small online interactive experience that mimics its dynamic particle effects. This artwork uses advanced motion-sensing technology to capture the real-time movements of visitors, influencing the projected particles as they navigate the space. As participants approach or move through areas, particles scatter, simulating physical impacts and altering water flows visually. My project will allow users to control particle movement and trajectory via mouse or other devices, offering direct interaction with the changing patterns and celebrating the beauty of fluid motion and user engagement.

# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

2.I plan to utilize the Wavemaker code to simulate dynamic particle flows, creating a foundation for my interactive artwork. This will involve recalculating particle trajectories and position changes to achieve the specific particle formations I envision. Additionally, I will integrate ml5's handpose code, allowing users to guide particles through gestures. This interaction will enable the particles to respond in various forms based on the gestures made. The visual effects of the particles will be rendered dynamically, reflecting the interactor's actions, which will enhance the immersive experience of the artwork.
